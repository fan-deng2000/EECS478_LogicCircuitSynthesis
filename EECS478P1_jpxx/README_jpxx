This project is mainly concerned with the basic concept and operation of binary decision diagram(BDD). 
The first part of the project is the apply function. It is used to perform basic operations like AND, OR, and XOR between two BDDs. The next two parts of the code are positive cofactors and negative cofactors. These two parts are used to implement the cofactor functions of BDD. The fourth part implements the Boolean difference of a Boolean function by XORing the negative cofactor with the positive cofactor of a Boolean function. The check_P_equivalence function is used to check if two Boolean functions have the same probability. Similar, the check_SC_equivalence function is used to check if two Boolean functions are SC-equivalence. 
I have tried different cases for testing the code. The overall project runs pretty good and it could implement a correct result. However, there is one problem about the check_SC_equivalence function. It could return a correct answer in some cases, but it could also meet some errors when the value of num_vars is changed.
